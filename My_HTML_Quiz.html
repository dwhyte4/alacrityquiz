            <h3>Section 3</h3>

            <li>HTML = Hypertext Markup Language</li> 

            <li>HTML is used as the default scripting language for writing web pages. It is the backbone of a web page consisting of several different elements.</li>

            <li>
                 <a href="www.example.com" target="_blank">Click Here </a> 
            </li>

            <li>CSS = Cascading Style Sheets </li>

            <li>CSS is used to designate styles to the relevant element tag within an HTML document.</li>

            <li>
                You can implement CSS in two ways:
                <ul>
                    <li>As a seperate file labelled ".css" which is then referenced with a "Link" tag within the "Header" tag of an HTML document.</li>

                    <li>Alternatively, you can apply styles directly within an HTML document as attributes within an element or tag of an HTML document using the following syntax for CSS e.g < h1 style="color:red">< /h1>. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
